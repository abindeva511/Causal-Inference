# Addition of New Features to A Game

The gaming team of a mobile gaming company introduced a new online community feature in their new game. The online community provided users with multiple ways to connect and interact within the game â€“ both during and outside of gameplay. The gaming team believes this new feature improved user revenue and retention within the game. 

We are analyzing the data and looking to see if there is actually any increase and if so is it due to the addition of the new feature. 
We will be looking to answer 3 major questions - 
(1)    Has the online community increased user revenue?
(2)    Has the online community led to increased retention? 
(3)    Has the online community led to an increase in CLV? (Assuming a margin of 50% of customer spend)
